# 6.4-backbone-exercises

This project was quite challenging. This assignment consisted of a series of objectives to complete using Backbone Models, Collections, and Views. This was probably the most challenging assignment to date, particularly because of Backbone Views. After working with React, I definitely prefer the way React components work as a view structure as opposed to Backbone's.
